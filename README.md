# PlantWire Server Image
This repository contains everything needed to create a yocto embedded linux image of the PlantWire-Server for the NanoPi neo.

# Building
If you don't want to use the prebuild image available on github you can build the yocto image yourself.

## Prerequisites
1. Have a linux build machine. Make sure it has enough ressources to properly build as build time is heavily affected by the performance of the build system.
2. Install the prerequisites for yocto building. You can see the required packages [here](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/ref-manual/system-requirements.html#required-packages-for-the-build-host).
